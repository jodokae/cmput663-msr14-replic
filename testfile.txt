Sigh? It's fixed, man - rejoice!!
Wow amazing thread! even If I'm not a Rails developer!
MY PRECIOUSSS!!!
If PHP code is producing errors with register globals on you are terrible terrible programmer. If you are using magic quotes you are simply stupid.
But this commit message makes me sad :cry:
This is really terrible - changing :private to :public without any deprecation warning? Not cool.
